      "1. **Cricket originated in England, but is now most popular in Asia and Australia:** While it began in villages across England as early as the 16th century, cricket's global popularity surged in the 20th century thanks to India, Pakistan, Australia, and other nations. Today, it's a truly international sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **The world's largest cricket stadium is in India:** The Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India, boasts a capacity of over 132,000 spectators. Thatâ€™s larger than the population of many small towns!\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **There are more formats of cricket than just Test Matches:** Alongside the traditional five-day Test matches, there's One Day International (ODI) cricket, which lasts for a single day, and Twenty20 (T20) cricket, a fast-paced version that completes in around three hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **\"Duck\" isn't just a bird, it's a cricketing term:** If a batsman scores zero runs and gets out in the same innings, they are said to have been \"duck.\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **The first ever Cricket World Cup was held in 1975:**  The inaugural tournament was won by the West Indies, and it has since become a major global sporting event, showcasing the best cricketing talent from around the world.\n",
